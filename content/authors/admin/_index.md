I am a PhD candidate at [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics), [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) and member of the [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) (ILCC). My interests lie in healthy aging and discovering early cognitive decline or impairment. I am focusing on neurolinguistic verbal/utterance data to explore semantic analysis using Natural Language Processing methods. My main goal is investigating important features on Sequence analysis in the light of various of feature extraction methodologies. Developing Natural Language Processing based applications for healthcare professionals applying automated features derived from cognitive tests, particularly verbal fluency.

My research interests are;

+  Semantic analysis
+  Machine learning
+  Natural Language Processing and applications
+  Statistics
+  Cognitive Psychology
+  Cognitive Assessment Tests
+  Verbal Fluency
